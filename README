This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-noob-kernel-dev layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Thought Process
===============
When I thought I should start learning Linux device driver I started reading LDD3.
Learning something like this without doing hands-on does not make sense.
Now doing that stuff on your workstation(only one) is not a good idea and also
workstation(Ubuntu kind of Linux-based) does not allow you to experiment with the
hardware too to some extent.
So why not use a popular embedded Linux board as a TRUE development board for
software development, in our case device-driver development.
We setup a basic Yocto build that can compile Linux images for the Raspberry Pi board.
But it does not have all the stuff we need to start developing drivers on the target natively.
Here we are, with our custom layer which add all the required tools to build a basic
device driver on the target(Raspberry Pi) itself.
With this we no need to:
Implement -> Cross-Compile -> Generate Images -> Flash(very tedious) -> Stare at console -> Repeat.
Enjoy!
